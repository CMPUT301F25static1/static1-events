Before participating in any draws or games, users should read the rules presented in the App. The FishyLottery team reserves the right to modify, pause, or cancel any game, draw, or event at any time.

If the App includes virtual currency, users acknowledge it has no real-world value. Transactions are handled by third-party platforms, and the FishyLottery team is not responsible for external errors.

Users must not attempt to manipulate the App, interfere with gameplay mechanics, or access systems beyond what is made available. Abusive or illegal behavior may result in account termination.
